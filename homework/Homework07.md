1. What is a class? According to the book, what does a class “arrange?”
	* Class is the root word of the term classification. When you design a class, you systematically arrange information and behavior into a meaningful entity.
	* a class is a type. you call it a class when you're writing the program. You call it a type while you're using it. 
2. What are the two purposes of encapsulatiohn?
	* To combine methods and data within a class; in other words, to support classification
	* To control the accessibility of the methods and data; in other words, to control the use of the class
3. How do you instantiate an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?
	* use the NEW keyword, by assigning a valid value to the instance
	* (instantiate)decalre it by passing a variable, access it by calling it, or passing a value to it, or using the access operator "."
4. What is the default access of the fields and methods of a class? How do you change the default?
	* the default access of the fields and methods of a class is private
	* use key word public to change it
5. What is the syntax for writing a constructor?
	*  Just add a public method that does not return a value and give it the same name as the class. 
6. What is the difference between class fields and methods, and instance fields ad methods? How do you
create class fields and methods?
	* instance methods use an instance of a class, class methods can be used with just the class name. 
	* Methods that belong to a class and that operate on the data belonging to a particular instance of a class are called instance methods.
	* when you designate a variable or methods as "static", it becomes a class fields and methods. 
7. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?
	* using static System.Math;
	* so you can omit the class name when accessing static members
8. Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class? What is it?
	* anonymous class is a class without a name. 
9. What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.
	* In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.
10. What is message passing as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.
	* In computer science, message passing is a technique for invoking behavior on a computer.
	* when you turn the key, you pass the message to the start motor to start the car
11. What was the first object-oriented programming language?
	* simula
